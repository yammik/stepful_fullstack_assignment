# API Docs â€“ Quiz App

## 1. Overview

Environments

- Local dev server [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

## 2. Authentication

A middleware is sketched out with a hardcoded user ID in this demo. Incoming requests to all routes in this API are decorated with the user ID. This was meaningful because the Resume feature involves attempts which are user-scoped.

## 3. Resource Model

Entities

- `Quiz`: id title version questions[]
- `Attempt`: id quizId userId current score finished updatedAt version

Invariants

- An attempt belongs to one user and one quiz.
- A user may only have one unfinished attempt per quiz.
- Finished attempts are immutable (not implemented yet)
